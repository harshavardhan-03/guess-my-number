# Guess-My-Number
<ul>This is my first project. It's a simple number guessing game.</ul>

# How to play
>Input the number that you guess and check.
>If you've guessed it right, you win the game.
>If you've guessed it wrong, you can still try guessing till you get it right.
>To make it easy, It gives the hint whether the given number is lesser or higher than the Secret Number(number to be guessed).
>I have given the score board which will keep reducing for every wrong attempt.
>You will have 10 chances to guess.(Between 1 and 20)
>If you still didn't guess it right, then you lose the game.
>You can restart/play again by clicking on Again! button.
